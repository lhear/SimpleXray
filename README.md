SimpleXray is a high-performance proxy client for Android, **built upon the robust Xray-core ([@XTLS/Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core))**.

It features an **innovative approach**: **directly executing the official Xray-core binary**, unlike traditional JNI methods. This method isolates core logic from the app layer, boosting stability and maximizing Xray-core's native performance. SimpleXray aims to provide a stable and efficient network experience.

## Key Features

*   **Enhanced Stability**: By running Xray-core as an independent child process, SimpleXray avoids JNI complexities, potential memory issues, and app crashes linked to core library failures. This isolation significantly improves reliability.
*   **High Performance**: Leverages Xray-core's native speed and integrates [@heiher/hev-socks5-tunnel](https://github.com/heiher/hev-socks5-tunnel) for efficient Tun2socks, ensuring low latency and high throughput.
*   **User-Friendly**: Offers a clean, intuitive UI and simplified setup, making it easy for users to configure and manage connections.

## Unique Technical Approach

Most Xray-core Android clients use JNI to call a compiled .so library. While easy to integrate, this can cause stability issues like performance overhead, cross-language complexity, and app crashes if the core library fails.

**SimpleXray's core difference is how it starts and manages the proxy:**

On installation/update, the embedded Xray-core binary (as `libxray.so`) is extracted. When connecting, the app uses standard Android APIs to **run this binary as a separate child process**, not via JNI calls. Communication happens via defined Inter-Process Communication (IPC).

This design preserves the original Xray-core binary's stability and performance while physically isolating the core process from the main app, enhancing reliability and security.

## Data Files (`geoip.dat` / `geosite.dat`)

The project **includes a simplified version** with basic rules (`"geoip:private"`, `"geoip:cn"`, `"geosite:gfw"`) from [@lhear/v2ray-rules-dat](https://github.com/lhear/v2ray-rules-dat).

## Quick Start

1.  **Requirement**: Android 10 or higher.
2.  **Get App**: Download the APK from the [Release Page](https://github.com/lhear/SimpleXray/releases) or get it from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.simplexray.an).
3.  **Install**: Install the APK on your device.
4.  **Configure**: Launch the app, import or manually add server details.
5.  **Connect**: Select a config and tap connect.

## Build Guide (Developers)

1.  **Environment**: Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and configure the Android SDK.
2.  **Get Code**: Clone the repo and submodules:
    ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/lhear/SimpleXray
    ```
3.  **Import**: Open the project in Android Studio.
4.  **Integrate Core**: Place the Xray-core binary (`libxray.so`) for your target architecture in `app/src/main/jniLibs/[architecture directory]`. E.g., `app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libxray.so`.
5.  **Add Data Files**: Place `geoip.dat` and `geosite.dat` files into the `app/src/main/assets/` directory. These are required for routing.
6.  **Build**: Sync Gradle and run the build task.
