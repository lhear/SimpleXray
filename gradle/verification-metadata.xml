    Dependency Verification Metadata
    
    This file is used by Gradle to verify the integrity of dependencies.
    It contains SHA-256 checksums for all dependencies used in the build.
    
    IMPORTANT: This file is currently a template. To enable verification:
    
    1. Run: ./gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256
    2. Review the generated checksums
    3. Commit the updated file to version control
    
    After generation, Gradle will automatically verify all dependencies
    during build. If a checksum mismatch is detected, the build will fail.
    
    Security Note:
    - This file MUST be committed to version control
    - Updates to this file should be reviewed carefully
    - New dependencies require checksum regeneration
    
    See DEPSECURITY.md for detailed instructions.

            and add GPG keys to <trusted-keys> section.
            Note: Not all dependencies have GPG signatures.

        Trusted artifacts and checksums will be auto-generated here.
        
        To generate checksums:
        ./gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256
        
        This will populate <trusted-keys> and <components> sections
        with actual SHA-256 checksums for all dependencies.
        
        After generation, this comment section will be replaced with
        actual checksum data.
